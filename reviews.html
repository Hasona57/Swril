            <h2>My Game Reviews</h2>
            <p>Here's what I think about some games I played. I just rate them on how much I liked them and if they're worth playing.</p>

                <h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
                <div class="rating">Rating: 7/10</div>
                <p class="para1">Finally played this game after hearing it got better. The story is pretty good and the city looks cool. Graphics are really nice on my PC.</p>
                <p class="para2">Combat is fun but gets boring after a while. I like the hacking stuff and all the different upgrades you can get.</p>
                <p class="para3">It's a decent game now that they fixed most bugs. Worth playing if you like sci-fi games but still has some glitches.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="review-card">
                <h3>Elden Ring</h3>
                <div class="rating">Rating: 9/10</div>
                <p class="para1">This game is really hard but amazing. I died so many times but kept playing because the world is beautiful. There's always something cool to find.</p>
                <p class="para2">Boss fights are crazy hard. Some took me hours but winning feels so good. Combat is smooth once you learn it.</p>
                <p class="para3">If you played Dark Souls you'll love this. If not, expect to die a lot but don't quit! It's worth it when you finally beat a boss.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="review-card">
                <h3>Among Us</h3>
                <div class="rating">Rating: 8/10</div>
                <p class="para1">This game was huge during covid and I can see why. It's simple but really fun with friends. Every game is different.</p>
                <p class="para2">Being the impostor is scary but fun. You have to lie and sabotage stuff. Being crew is cool too trying to figure out who's lying.</p>
                <p class="para3">Best with voice chat and friends. Playing with randoms online is weird sometimes. But with good people it's really funny.</p>
